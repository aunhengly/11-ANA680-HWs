    "The assignment for this week has two main objectives: \n",
    "1) to reinforce understanding and application of container technology; and \n",
    "2) to build, train, test, and deploy ML projects on the AWS cloud using Amazon EC2 with and without container technology. Only select between 3 - 5 top features for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This assignment uses the Wine Quality Dataset at the UCI repository:  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality. The model will predict the wine quality, which has a score between 0 and 10 from the 11 given features:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1 - fixed acidity\n",
    "   2 - volatile acidity\n",
    "   3 - citric acid\n",
    "   4 - residual sugar\n",
    "   5 - chlorides\n",
    "   6 - free sulfur dioxide\n",
    "   7 - total sulfur dioxide\n",
    "   8 - density\n",
    "   9 - pH\n",
    "   10 - sulfates\n",
    "   11 - alcohol  \n",
    "\n",
    "Build the model for predicting the wine quality. Containerize the model and deploy it on Heroku.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Deploy the containerized model in problem 1 on the AWS EC2. "
